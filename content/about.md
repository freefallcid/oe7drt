Hello, my name is Dominic and I maintain this website.  
I am a licensed ham radio operator since 2019 and my callsign is **OE7DRT**.

My QTH is **LÃ¤ngenfeld** [^lgfd] - the locator for that is
[JN57lb](http://www.levinecentral.com/ham/grid_square.php?Grid=JN57lb).

[^lgfd]: You can also write this like: Laengenfeld

## The equipment I use

- Icom IC-7300 transceiver
- PSU-1250 switched-mode power supply 50A
- 12Ah 12V LiFePo4 battery (for portable use)
- 12Ah 12V AGM battery (for not so portable use)
- MFJ-993B antenna tuner
- MFJ-269C SWR analyzer
- CHA HYBRID MICRO in combination with
  - CHA MIL WHIP 2.0
  - CHA MIL EXTENSION 2.0
  - 60' wire (~18m)
- CHA EMCOMM II (matching box with 60' wire)  
- Complete Multiband Antenna 6-80m  
  (AlphaAntenna) - **I do not recommend this antenna, this is wasted money!**
- 10m antenna mast (fiberglass)
- Hytera PD-785G
- Anytone D878UV+  
  **I also cannot recommend this device.**  
  CPS is very buggy and my device does not get recognised from Windows
  (I tried three different windows notebooks)

## Other resources

I used to maintain a broader range of topics on my other website
`dominicreich.com` - but keeping track of all the changes in the more complex
hugo theme made me decide to implement most articles in this smaller one.

For reference, my older website are still accessible on the following URLs:

- [dominicreich.com jekyll version](https://dominicreich-old.netlify.com/)  
  you can search this website with algolia search
- [dominicreich.com hugo version](https://dominicreich.com/)  
  next version of the older jekyll version but still a few style things won't
  work correctly
