Hello, my name is Dominic and I maintain this website.  
I am a licensed ham radio operator since 2019 and my callsign is **OE7DRT**.

My QTH is **LÃ¤ngenfeld** [^lgfd] - the locator for that is
[JN57lb](http://www.levinecentral.com/ham/grid_square.php?Grid=JN57lb).

[^lgfd]: You can also write this like: Laengenfeld

## About this website

My website is a personal storage of a set of information about many different
things --- mostly about ham radio and other tech stuff. The main goal of my blog
is for my personal usage. That is because some articles may not explain
everything --- I hope I can reproduce a working setup with all the steps in
these articles.

*I could have saved some links in my bookmarks, right?* Well, I have. But I do that
now for a long time and it sometimes happens, that one or another link becomes
unavailable and hosting my own set of information does not result in these
situations in any way.

You can use the information on these pages for yourself. Just keep in mind, that
some of them may not be very objective or even accurate. The reverse is true. I
fill them with my opinions and experiences; some with solutions --- some not.

## The equipment I use

- Icom IC-7300 transceiver
- PSU-1250 switched-mode power supply 50A
- 12Ah 12V LiFePo4 battery (for portable use)
- 12Ah 12V AGM battery (for not so portable use)
- MFJ-993B antenna tuner
- MFJ-269C SWR analyzer
- CHA HYBRID MICRO in combination with
  - CHA MIL WHIP 2.0
  - CHA MIL EXTENSION 2.0
  - 60' wire (~18m)
- CHA EMCOMM II (matching box with 60' wire)  
- Complete Multiband Antenna 6-80m  
  (AlphaAntenna) - **I regret buying this antenna.**
- 10m antenna mast (fiberglass)
- Hytera PD-785G
- Anytone D878UV+  
  I run into problems with this device as the computer stopped connecting to the
  radio all of a sudden. I was literally flashing the shit out of the radio when
  I was testing different setups on my codeplug. I got the device back and I got
  told to not send whilst the programming cable is plugged in. Now **I always shut
  down the radio when I unplug it** and I make sure to **not have GPS enabled**
  because APRS could send out beacons while plugged into the computer.

## Other resources

I used to maintain a broader range of topics on my other website
`dominicreich.com` - but keeping track of all the changes in the more complex
hugo theme made me decide to implement most articles in this smaller one.

For reference, my older website are still accessible on the following URLs:

- [dominicreich.com jekyll version](https://dominicreich-old.netlify.com/)  
  you can search this website with algolia search
- [dominicreich.com hugo version](https://dominicreich.com/)  
  next version of the older jekyll version but still a few style things won't
  work correctly
